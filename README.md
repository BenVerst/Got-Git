## Objectives:

#### 1. Recreate plot (below) using data from the Luquillo Experimental Forest Long-Term Ecological Research project (LEF-LTER) found at:
#### McDowell, W. and International Institute of Tropical Forestry(IITF), USDA Forest Service.. 2022. Chemistry of stream water from the Luquillo Mountains ver 4923061. Environmental Data Initiative. <https://doi.org/10.6073/pasta/570231c2807a6396ced6a89ef7547bd4> (Accessed 2023-08-31). (Found in recreate_plot.qmd)

#### 2. Define and explore our own question! (Found in question.qmd)
#### Question asked: How does temperature at each site affect nitrate and potassium concentrations?
#### Quarto document includes data exploration and preliminary plots on the effects of temperature on various parameters.
